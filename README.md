Hello! First thing's first, youtube-dl is required for you to use the downloading feature whereas ffmpeg is required to use the convert/trim section

Here is a setup guide I made on youtube for how to setup youtube-dl! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5axVgHHDBvU

Here is an album of pictures of the program in action: https://imgur.com/a/U24lOV3

And a list of things it can be used to do!

1) Trim a file with a specified time gap 
2) Convert a file to a specified format 
3) Download any supported link to a specified location 
4) Download only a specified portion of a supported link (which I am most proud of) as in from x time to z time 
5) Add youtube-dl's path your system's path (or any other chosen directory/program for that matter) 
6) Embed Thumbnails (Atomic Parsley required: http://atomicparsley.sourceforge.net/)
7) Include Subtitles (if available) 
8) Exe name change taken into account if applicable
9) Download and specify a range for a playlist 
10) Update youtube-dl 
11) Wipe youtube-dl's cache 
12) See a list of available formats for a given link 
13) Download multiple links in the same queue 
14) Copy command to clipboard instead of executing 
15) Prioritize highest quality
16) Specify title of new file
17) Specify download location for any process

I'm very proud of this program since I put a lot of work into it, I would appreciate it greatly if you check it out! Thanks for reading :)
