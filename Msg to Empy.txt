Reaching out about youtube-dl :)


Hello Empyrealist! I wanted to take you up on your offer of reaching out that you made in this comment on my post https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedl/comments/kj1llz/i_made_a_program_in_excel_that_automates/gh37tac

I went ahead and made yet another program, but this time I made it as a desktop windows app, as opposed to inside something like excel. I also jam packed a lot of features into it as well, such as:

1) Trim a file with a selected time gap
2) Convert a file to a specified format
3) Download any supported link to a specified location
4) Download only a specified portion of a supported link (which I am most proud of) as in from x time to z time
5) Add youtube-dl's path your system's path (or any other chosen directory for that matter)
6) Embed Thumbnails 
7) Include Subtitles
8) Exe name change taken into account
9) Download and specify a range for a playlist
10) Update youtube-dl
11) Wipe youtube-dl's cache
12) See a list of available formats for a given link
13) Download multiple links in the same queue
14) Copy command to clipboard instead of executing
15) Prioritize highest quality
*every download goes into a specified location

And the cherry on top: I've simulated the console output into a text window so you will have the terminal information from within the app!

Here is an album of it in action for some reference, as well as the github link:

& where you would download it from: https://github.com/emberedsky/skydl/releases



So I wanted to reach out and explain some of the format decisions I've made to make sure you see no issues with what I'm doing. There are things I want to bring up for both ffmpeg & youtube-dl.

Youtube-dl: 

-The 'Prioritize highest quality' checkbox is actually a little deceiving, since it's a subtraction not an addition of parameters, to make sure no input for quality is made, to fall back on youtube-dl's default, which should be the highest quality possible, as you taught me! If it is unchecked it goes back to -f best, unless specify format code is checked (or download a portion is also checked). Do you think this is okay??

- For my entire logic behind downloading a portion this was a little tricky since it is a two command process. First I need to fetch the link's url using youtube-dl and its --get-url command, or -g. I realized if I leave youtube-dl's default quality, it returns back two streams, one which is the best video stream possible, and one which is the best audio stream possible, separated by a line break. This made things complicated, so I tried looking for solutions. I realized if i input -f best it returns one stream with both video and audio, and that makes it so all I would need to do is throw that one link into ffmpeg's input, which is the second command of the process. Do you think that's a permissible sacrifice??

Ffmpeg:

I learned about the preset speed parameters for .h264 encoding (-preset) https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264 & for VP9 encoding (-speed) https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/VP9 so I instead of giving the choice to the user, I chose a speed relatively fast speed compared to the the default speed, veryfast for h264 and 6 for vp9 (out of 9). I figured it would be way more cluttered than it already is if I also give them options to input a speed selection so I just input it myself as opposed to keeping it to default. The default speed seemed to slow so that's why I changed it, do you think I'm losing too much quality to make this justified simply because of lack of patience? I don't want to cut too many corners here. 

Sorry for the wall of text, but I am passionate about this and would LOVE any feedback!! Thank you in advance!
